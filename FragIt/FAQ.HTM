<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> What is FragIt?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> SNM is such a program 
that can split a file in several fragment and merge those fragments to form the 
original file.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Why did you made it?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> Actually it was a 
request from one of my friends. Anyway, transferring data from one PC to another 
by floppy disk is a very popular method. But for less data capacity, files 
larger then 1.38 MB cannot be transferred with it. So I developed this program 
to split a large file into fragments that can fit in a floppy disk and after 
transferring all the fragment files this program has the capability to merge 
those files to form the original one. This program was also made for those who 
have slow internet connection so they can upload files in fragments.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> How long did it take 
you to develop it?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> About 7-8 days to 
program and debug it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Is there any data 
loss in the file split and merge process?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> No, there is no data 
loss in the process but if you spot any please let me know.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> To browse a file can 
take a while, is there any other way to select a file faster?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> Yes, the program 
supports both browse and drag-and-drop option. The drag-and-drop option lets you 
drag a file from the desktop directly to the text fields. This saves a lot of 
time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> If I change the 
fragment file name, would the program be able to merge the files?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> No, it is highly 
recommended you don’t change the fragment file name. This can cause you a lot of 
trouble.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Why is the interface 
of the program so small?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> I don’t like utility 
programs take a lot of space on screen and personally I like compressed 
interface. But I did all to make this program’s interface understandable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> I am trying to split 
a file but I can’t. I gave it a valid file name, fragment size but it is showing 
an error message. What should I do?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> The problem is 
common. This program doesn’t support file overwriting. So if you are attempting 
to split a file more then once in the same directory. You may face this problem. 
Try deleting previously created fragment files. Another thing is that this 
program can split a file by 999 times but if you enter a fragment value that can 
generate files more then this value can cause you the same problem.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> I am having problem 
merging files although I have all the fragment files in the same directory and 
selected a valid fragment file. What do I do now?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> As told before this 
program doesn’t support file overwriting. If you are trying to merge more then 
once then you might have end up merging into the same file. Try deleting the 
previously created file or just use that file.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> How may I contact 
with you if I need to?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> You can email me at
<a href="mailto:lifeforcez@hotmail.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
lifeforcez@hotmail.com</a> asking any question about this program. I’ll be glad 
to help you. </font></p>
